          <h4>Zodiac App</h4>
          <p>
            Using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I built a fun landing page on
            a topic of my choosing: the Chinese Zodiac. I provided a brief
            history of its origins and created a fun button! The button is a
            Zodiac Animal Generator which works by the user entering their
            birthday and then utilizing Javascript arrays, if/else statements,
            and functions it will retrieve a Zodiac Animal based on the year.
            This project was a great way to learn something new while getting to
            explore a topic I already loved.<br /><br />
            2022 is the Year of the Tiger - the king of all beasts and the
            center of attention in most social circles! This year symbolizes
            strength and bravery. Babies born this year will also be smart,
            confident, humorous, and good at socializing.

          <h4>Weather App</h4>
          <p>
            I created a Weather App with a Search Engine feature and a forecast
            for the week ahead. To create this I used HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            Bootstrap and API integration. The project really pushed the limits
            as we only used Vanilla Javascript - but were able to make something
            pretty complex. The three quick links are the home cities of my
            family. I'm based in Charlotte, my parents are in Houston, and my
            sister is in Portland. <br /><br />
            Golden Hour is a reference to the hour of the sun rising and sun
            setting. It's the time of day when the most beautiful golden light
            is spread. This is when nature wakes up and then goes to sleep. It's
            known to be the best hours for photography as the light captured is
            unlike any other.

          <h4>Interior Design</h4>
          <p>
            Before I shifted my interests to Front-End Development, I come from
            a background of over 10 years in Customer Service and Management,
            and over 6 years in Interior Design. I have a Bachelor's Degree in
            Fashion Merchandising and while I started in apparel, I eventually
            moved into home furnishings. My career has spanned retailers like
            Anthropologie and Pottery Barn, and most recently a position as a
            Remote Interior Designer for Modsy.<br /><br />Interior Design is a
            huge passion of mine and I love helping my clients bring their
            visions to life. I've been lucky enough to work on everything from
            townhomes, to Air BnB properties (on multiple continents), to
            corporate offices. I particularly enjoy designing modern,
            multi-purpose spaces and pushing the boundaries of style and
            function. <br /><br />For a complete work history check out my
