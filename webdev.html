          <h4>Photography Website</h4>
          <p>
            I had the chance to create a photography portfolio and booking site for a local photographer and friend. 
            He gave me pretty much complete creative freedom with the design which made for a really fun project. 
            He had amazing pictures to work with, which made my job much easier. My favorite part was working on the 
            responsive aspects of the site so that it would look great on all devices.<br /><br />If you're in the NC/SC area, 
            and you're looking for a photographer, I encourage you to check him out! He photographs everything from events, to cars, 
            to babies, family portraits, weddings, and everything in between.

            Using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I built a fun landing page on
            a topic of my choosing: the Chinese Zodiac. I provided a brief
            history of its origins and created a fun button! The button is a
            Zodiac Animal Generator which works by the user entering their
            birthday and then utilizing Javascript arrays, if/else statements,
            and functions it will retrieve a Zodiac Animal based on the year.
            This project was a great way to learn something new while getting to
            explore a topic I already loved.<br /><br />
              2022 is the Year of the Tiger - the king of all beasts and the
              center of attention in most social circles! This year symbolizes
              strength and bravery. Babies born this year will also be smart,
              confident, humorous, and good at socializing.

          <p>
            I created a Weather App with a Search Engine feature and a forecast
            for the week ahead. To create this I used HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            Bootstrap, Axios, and API integration. The project really pushed the limits
            as we only used Vanilla Javascript - but were able to make something
            pretty complex. The three quick links are the home cities of my
            family. I'm based in Charlotte, my parents are in Houston, and my
            sister is in Portland. <br /><br />
              Always Sunny is a reference to one of my favorite TV Shows, but also to the weather that I'm always hoping for every time I check the app. The more sunshine the better!

           I created a dictionary React App with a Search Engine feature. It utilizes React and JSX, Bootstrap, Axios,

           I named it the Magic Dictionary because it summarizes how I felt about coding when I first started to learn: that it was like magic! 
           Hundreds of hours later, I know that it's all written in the code rather than the divine work of a spell.

           Are you easily distracted? I know that I can be.

This little tomato timer 🍅 is based on the Pomodoro Technique which is supposed to help limit external distractions and help with focus and flow. 
Basically you work undistracted for 25 mins and then reward yourself with a little 5 min break.
I originally made it with Python and the Tkinter package and shared it with my followers on LinkedIn, who absolutely loved it!
That led me to creating a web app version with React. I'm planning to add more features soon, but for now it's helping me stay on track while studying.

            <h4>Python Projects</h4>
            <p>
              I'm currently learning Python programming! I've created a bunch of fun
              games as a part of my learning journey with #100DaysOfCode, a
              Python Course from The App Brewery. It's an exciting way to strengthen my coding muscles and build new skills. My favorite so far is my remake of the Classic Snake Arcade Game! I remember playing this on my Nokia 3310 phone in 2003. 😆<br /><br />
              Check out my progress with the games below:
