      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h3>Shelby Courtney, Front-End Developer</h3>
            <p class="aboutmesection">
              My passion for tech started as a child. The "computer room" (a
              staple of the early 2000s) was my favorite room. I would lose
              myself for hours in games like Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.
              
              As a teenager, tech became something different in my life as my
              interests shifted to social media. I would be up until 2 or 3 am
              working on the HTML and CSS of my MySpace page - perfecting it
              with my favorite colors and coding it to autoplay my favorite
              songs (cringe!). As a young adult, I studied Fashion
              Merchandising, and tech became a way to see the future: trend
              boards, color stories, line sheets, and plan-o-grams. I loved
              creating 3D visualizations of a display in PhotoShop.<span id="dots">...</span>
              <span id="more">
              <br /><br />As my career in merchandising progressed, it shifted
              toward sales and management - an area I naturally excelled at
              since I'm always described as the girl with the "bubbly
              personality". For the first time, tech became something
              frustrating in my life. I would work for well-established
              retailers who were running successful and productive businesses,
              yet they ran on antiquated technology. <br><br>I found that to
              be the trend in my retail career: smart, business-savvy leaders
              working with programs that were outdated by at least a decade, or
              simply not using tech at all and running the business with pen and
              paper! I would find myself asking the question of "why?" - and it
              usually boiled down to confusing interfaces that weren't straight
              forward for the user. It bred an environment of intimidation when
              it came to technology and the retail world. There tended to be
              large learning curves because software wasn't intuitive.<br /><br />
              I used tech to increase efficiency where I could. I converted as
              many pen and paper tasks to the computer as possible: scheduling,
              business acumen, training materials, clienteling. And then I
              focused on making the tools I created as easy as possible to
              navigate so they would actually be used. I invested time into
              communicating and training how the tools worked and asked for
              feedback on how to make them better. I became the person who could
              create a training on any topic using Powerpoint or Slides, and
              make it in a format that was understandable.<br /><br />
              The more opportunity I had to work on projects like this, the
              better I felt. Creating tools and improving processes/experiences
              is a task that is energy-building for me. I am a problem solver by
              nature.<br /><br />
              In 2022, I decided to take a leap of faith and start a career in
              tech! I am particularly interested in Front End Development, User
              Experience and User Interface, and helping bridge the gap in
              technology use in the retail/customer service world. I believe the
              best tech products are beautiful to look at and easy to use from
              any experience level.
