        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p class="aboutmesection">
          My passion for tech started as a child. The "computer room" (a staple
          of the early 2000s) was my favorite room. I would lose myself for
          hours in games like Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims. As a teenager,
          tech became something different in my life as my interests shifted to
          social media. I would be up until 2 or 3 am working on the HTML and
          CSS of my MySpace page - perfecting it with my favorite colors and
          coding it to autoplay my favorite songs (cringe!). As a young adult, I
          studied Fashion Merchandising, and tech became a way to see the
          future: trend boards, color stories, line sheets, and plan-o-grams. I
          loved creating 3D visualizations of a display in PhotoShop.<span
            id="dots"
            >...</span
          >
          <span id="more">
            <br /><br />As my career in merchandising progressed, technology became something frustrating in my life. I
            would work for well-established retailers who were running
            successful and productive businesses, yet they ran on antiquated
            technology. <br /><br />I found that to be the trend in my retail
            career: smart, business-savvy leaders working with programs that
            were outdated by at least a decade, or simply not using tech at all
            and running the business with pen and paper! I would find myself
            asking the question of "why?" - and it usually boiled down to
            confusing interfaces that weren't straight forward for the user. It
            bred an environment of intimidation when it came to technology and
            the retail world. There tended to be large learning curves because
            software wasn't intuitive.<br /><br />
            I used tech to increase efficiency where I could. I converted as
            many pen and paper tasks to the computer as possible: scheduling,
            business acumen, training materials, clienteling. And then I focused
            on making the tools I created as easy as possible to navigate so
            they would actually be used. I invested time into communicating and
            training how the tools worked and asked for feedback on how to make
            them better. I became the person who could create a training on any
            topic, and make it in a format that was
            understandable.<br /><br />
            The more opportunity I had to work on projects like this, the better
            I felt. Creating tools and improving processes/experiences is a task
            that is energy-building for me. I am a problem solver by nature. <br /><br />
            Throughout the Pandemic I witnessed technology in a new way - I wasn't just 
            seeing the generational gaps in how technology was used, but also saw large gaps in social accessibility. 
            Technology is meant to be our blessing, but for certain groups it probably felt more like a curse. From a Trauma-Informed perspective, 
            technology was probably even causing some harm. I realized I had been solving problems on a small scale with technology in my career, but what if there was potential for something bigger? What if I could help make apps that bridged equity gaps or interfaces that made sense to the inexperienced user?
            What if I could make technology products that were helpful and empowering to marginalized groups?<br /><br />
            After experiencing my own trauma, life shifted upside down for me. I looked at what made me happy and I decided to make some big changes in my life.
            I decided it was time to pursue my passion in tech. I learned to code with SheCodes and had an absolute blast earning my certification in Front End Development! I'm currently learning Python, and having even more fun programming solutions to complex problems. 
            My learning journey is only beginning - and the great thing with this industry is there seems to be endless potential to how much you can learn.<br><br> 
            I am particularly interested in Front End Development and User
            Experience, and helping bridge the gaps in
            technology use. I believe the
            best tech products are beautiful to look at, accessible to all, and easy to use from any
            experience level.
